#Console Logging Mode. Accepted Values: "None", "Severe", "Normal", "Debug", "Timer"

#This is the method MCM will use to match Station Rule 'st-' conditions to a minecart's destination. Setting 1 is recommened.
#0 - Match exact station name (ignores case)
#1 - Pattern matching. 
#       @ is any letter, ignoring case
#       # is any digit
#       ? is any single character
#       * is anything
#      Examples:
#        st-Cityville* would match any station starting with Cityville
#        st-Cityville-A# would match stations Cityville-A0 through Cityville-A9
#2 - Full regex parsing.
StationParsingMethod: 1

#0 - Always prompt rider to tap cart in desired direction at intersections if destination cannot be determined
#1 - Prompt only when intersection is above a Station block and destination cannot be determined. (Use this if using [Station] signs instead of blocks)
#2 - Nerver prompt at intersections, unless explicitly on a Prompt block.

#Control blocks
#Control blocks are aliases for signs, when the minecart passes over one, it will execute the actions specified.
#See the items.txt file for the proper name of each block.
#Each entry below the block represents a sign. Use / to seperate the lines on each sign.
#You can specify a Redstone state for each individual sign by starting line 1 with (ON), (OFF), (TRIGGERON), or (TRIGGEROFF). 
#    ON and OFF actions are run when the minecart passes over it and the block has the correct power state.
#    TRIGGERON and TRIGGEROFF actions are run when the redstone power of the block changes to the specified state, whether or not a minecart is nearby.
#       Only Spawn and Launch can currently be triggered by redstone.
#Be sure to enclose the whole entry in double quotes ""
#Refer to the documentation for available signs and their syntax.
#Example
#   SOME_BLOCK:
#     - "[sign 1 line 1]"
#     - "[sign 2 line 1] / [sign 2 line 2]"
#     - "(ON) [redstone on sign]"
